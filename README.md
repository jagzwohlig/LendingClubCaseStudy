## General Information
- The project aims to assist a consumer finance company in making informed decisions when approving or rejecting loan applications.
- The company faces two types of risks: losing business by rejecting loan applications from borrowers who are likely to repay, and financial loss by approving loans to borrowers who are likely to default.
- The project utilizes historical loan data, including borrower characteristics and loan attributes, to identify patterns and factors that contribute to loan defaults.
- The dataset used in this project contains information about past loan applicants, their demographics, credit history, loan characteristics, and repayment status.

## Conclusions
- Loans with interest rates above 15% have a significantly higher default rate (33.3%) compared to the overall default rate (14.2%).
- Borrowers with longer employment lengths (10+ years) have a lower default rate, indicating that employment stability is a key factor in loan repayment.
- The majority of loans in the dataset are fully paid (85.8%), while a smaller proportion are charged off (14.2%).
- Loan amounts are right-skewed, with most loans falling in the range of $5,000 to $20,000.


## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.9.7
- pandas - version 1.3.4
- matplotlib - version 3.4.3
- seaborn - version 0.11.2
